# stat_calc

If you take any Statistics course, you'll realize that that are many arduous calculations that come into play.
In order to avoid many of these calculations and foucus on the bigger concepts, I decided to create the MINSTAT calculator.
It has the calculations neccessary for problems in an introductory Statistics class.
This calculations makes solving problems a lot easier and helps me understand how to do them better by designing a solution for them.

I created 35 different types of solutions to statistics problems that can be solved using this calculator.
Without further explanations, let's take a look.
When the user first uses the calculator, they get to choose from the following options:

The following are the 35 different types of problems and their solutions.
